                                   <p>The night that former president of Botswana, Ian Khama, escaped under the cover of darkness into 
                                        neighboring South Africa, marked a loss of innocence in Botswana’s usually stable, harmless politics.

                                        spilled out into the open. It threatens to inflame tribal malaise and destabilise a country once

                                        administering a daily average of 4,048 doses per 100,000 people in the past seven days. Nicaragua was

                                        the World Health Organization set out a  vaccination target for countries to meet. It said 
                                        countries should vaccinate 40% of its population by the end of 2021 and 70% by mid 2022.

                                   <p>In early May, President Mokgweetsi Masisi told a CNN journalist that Botswana was on the “verge” of becoming the first African country to vaccinate
                                         its entire adult population against the deadly coronavirus. With unbridled optimism, the president lauded the country’s experience fighting 
                                         pandemics, singling out the spirited battle against HIV/AIDS in the 90s. By mid-July however, things began to unravel. Social media feeds 
                                         surfaced with videos of Covid funerals, wailing relatives of the dead outside hospitals and long queues at testing centres with gasping patients.
