                                <p>The coronavirus pandemic has caused an unconventional recession and continues to contribute to the rising inflation rates in Botswana.  
Observers say this spike in consumer prices has been a headache to economists and policy makers.
Economists say an increase in prices at the height of the pandemic led to a spike in inflation, 
particularly in 2020 at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. Panic buying was partly to blame 
as consumers rushed to the grocery stores to stock pile. </p>
<p>But there was another factor that led to a push in prices. The demand for personal protective equipment 
(PPEs) also pushed prices up as households and health facilities jostled for supplies, particularly 
protective masks.</p>
<p>Economists say that inflation rates tend to rise, quite simply, when households want more goods and 
    services than firms can easily supply. And that both fear and COVID-related restrictions have shifted
     demand from services to goods. Between 2016 and 2020, the central bank maintained a stable inflation
      of around 3%. In earlier years, inflation remained high in the regions of 7% pushed by sustained 
      increase in food and fuel prices.  But subsequently maintained a steady decline in 2014 to 2020. 
      However, inflation picked in mid 2020 as household spending habits changed in line with mask mandate, 
      quarantine rules and lockdowns. The COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns led to an increase in demand 
      for commodities. This shift in demand for PPEs and food has contributed to overall inflation.</p>

<p>Finally, analysts said in 2020 and 2021, COVID reduced the supply of workers in Botswana and South Africa, 
    which means fewer goods and services produced and thus higher prices. South Africa is the major trading 
    partner with Botswana, exporting 85 percent of food stuff to Botswana. Industrial strikes in South Africa 
    and increases in employee quarantine led to fewer workers on the job and subsequently fewer goods and
     services provided. Start with the direct effect of the disease itself.</p>
